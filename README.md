## Features

* Three categories that query relevant APIs such as GitHub Jobs, Eventbrite, and Khanacademy when clicked and then display job listings, educational materials, and events based on which selection is checked.
* A message board that allows users to leave persistent messages that are displayed to other users. The most recent message is stored in Firebase to be displayed on the next visit.

## Issues Related To Project

* Search by keyword functionality implemented, but not properly explained to the user yet.
* Replace education API.
* Insert our own links.
* Condense firebase to being called once for all pages. (export module?)
* Move out of firebase server and into Node.js/mySQL server.
* Improve UX for user clarity.
* Add mailboxlayer API to check for valid email addresses.
* Change badges in queryPage to be two badges, one to say submit a message and the other to collapse the divs in query listings for easier scrollability, particularly jobs/events.
* Add more parameters to query listings for more descriptive listings, e.g. Employer Name, Location.
* Check out Chicago's open data sets, see how they can be integrated.
* Gain access to Google Maps API, include business locations in small div within listing.
* Glassdoor API? Show rating of company, former employee reviews, etc.
* Move away from Bootstrap, do more home-grown CSS and possibly Materialize.
* Build animated landing page.
* Feed doesn't seem to load on the first click of the radio toggle buttons? Loading wheel spins, plays, and then the feed doesn't load. It takes a couple of clicks to get it to work. Do we need to load the APIs on page load and have them ready to be displayed to solve this problem, and not on click?
* Disable clicking buttons again until animation completes.
* Add loading animation for chatbox, because it has white space on load.
